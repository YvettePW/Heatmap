# Heatmap
## Heatmap Project
<img src="heatmapimage.png" width='300'/>
This map is a heatmap of crime data from Chicago. A map of Chicago with a dark style uses GeoJSON data to add an overlay of a heatmap. The map can appear differently by changing the array numbers in the heatmap-weight and/or heatmap-intensity properties.<br></br>
To run this on your machine, youâ€™ll need all of these files and you'll need to load the .html file onto your browser (NOTE: API keys from Mapbox are currently not present in code. They are needed to run the code).<br></br>
Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to include an animated crime comparison over time.<br></br>
